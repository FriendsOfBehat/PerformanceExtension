Feature: Iron Maiden
    In order to learn how to write features
    As a young BDD padawan
    I want to translate lyrics into scenarios

    Scenario: The Number Of The Beast (basic functionality)
        Given I left alone
        And my mind was blank
        And I needed time to think
        When I get the memories from my mind
        Then the evil face should twist my mind
        And it should bring me to despair

    Scenario: The Trooper (cannot unpack array with string keys - usage of an argument transformer)
        When you take my life
        Then I should take yours too
